## Help & Guides

### Local Guide

1. Download the app at [https://github.com/Aerilym/SWRPG-Destiny-Point-Tracker](https://github.com/Aerilym/SWRPG-Destiny-Point-Tracker).
2. If the download is in a zip file make sure you unzip it before use.
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser or compatible program.

### Modification Guide

* Parts of the tools can be hidden or shown using the available buttons. Try them out.
* The image tokens used for dark and light side points can be change by replacing the 'dark0.sgv' and 'light.svg' files with sgv images of your choice. If you're willing to change some lines of code, open index.html and replace all occurrences of 'dark0.sgv' and 'light.svg' with the respective file names your images have. this allows you to use any valid image format (like png, jpg, webp, jpeg, gif, and more).  
NOTE: currently the image file names must be 9 characters long including the file extension (so can't change from the original file name length.) Similar to the file name change, if you replace all occurrences of '-9' to the length of the file names, you can use any file name length (both files need to have the same file name length).
